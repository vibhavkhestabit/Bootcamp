# Hestabit Development Launchpad

This repository contains my daily tasks and work completed during the **Hestabit Development Launchpad** bootcamp.

It is updated regularly with everyday assignments and practice work as I progress through the training. The repo mainly serves as a simple record of learning, hands-on tasks, and day-to-day development activities.
