# Documentation File for Day1 learnings

This is the documentation file where we are going to explain our learnings from week 2, Day1 tasks which included **HTML5 and Semantic Layout**

Here we got an overview of a webpage and we had to use only semantic tags to replicate it or a website of our own so that we get to know the functionalities and features of those tags thoroughly.

The core learnig for the day was to learn how to aptly use Semantic Tags which include Headers, Footers, Main, Article, figure, img, nav, etc

By name we can understand that every semantic tag has its own meaning and function.

## Page Structure 
The page is structured using semantic HTML5 elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer to clearly define the role of each part of the webpage. This improves readability, accessibility, and makes the layout easy to style later using CSS.

## Semantic Tags
1) <Header> is used to provide authentic metadata information which is need at the top of the section.
2) <Footer> is required to conclude the section with essential info.
3) <Section> helps us bifurcate and divide different parts in different sections.
4) <Article> helps us write and store a particular interval/section of some information which is indepent in its own. Section can store multiple articles.
5) <Navigation> tag helps to guide us about different locations.
6) <Aside> tag helps us to divide the data from the main and visualize it separately.

## Forms and Media

Forms were implemented using semantic elements such as form, label, input, select, option, and button to collect user input in an accessible way. Media elements like img were used with proper alt text to ensure better accessibility and content understanding.
