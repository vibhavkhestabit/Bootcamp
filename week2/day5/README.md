# Week 2: Frontend Fundamentals Learnings

This file will help us know about our learnings of Week 2 where we covered HTML, CSS and JS thoroughly.
Learning  basics to advance interactive level JS website at the end of the week.
In this report we will walkthrough our Week 2 journey covering each day deeply starting off with Day 1.

## Day 1: HTML5 + Semantic Layout

So as we are starting off with HTML and we have to know what HTML, CSS and JS core roles are:
**HTML- Structure => CSS- Presentation => JS- Behaviour**

This is onw of the most important learning which helps us understand whatever we are learning that eventually the core role while working and creating HTML pages is to give our webpage/content a structure or skeleton or meaning.
That is the sole purpose of a HTML file.

### Page Structure
The page structure of HTML file is divided into multiple section using multiple tags, starting off with:
1) Document Declartion
2) HTML: HTML Declaration
3) Head: Metadata purposes
4) Body: Contains the main content

## HTML Tags
HTML tags are enclosed brackets that enable to designate the role of content which has to be given to the browser, There are multiple different types of tags but the sole purpose of declaring tags is to define the role of content of the tags.
**HTML element => HTML opening tag + Content + HTML Closing Tag**

## Metadata
Metadata refers to the additional information which describes about the HTML page, its features and structure but it isnt the data.
Its just the information about the data.

## Semantic HTML5 
HTML5 is the latest version version of HTML which came out in 2014 and we will be going through the semantic HTML in detail.
Semantic HTML refers to **Clearly Describing the meaning** of whatever is being worked on at the moment;i.e.; every different action/section has its own tag/section which helps us to:
1) Improve accessibility
2) Makes the code self-explanatory
3) Enhances the Search Engine working

It provides **structural meaning** to the work which is being done.
Few commonly used Semantic Tags:
1) **Header** is used to provide authentic metadata information which is need at the top of the section.
2) **Footer** is required to conclude the section with essential info.
3) **Section** helps us bifurcate and divide different parts in different sections.
4) **Article** helps us write and store a particular interval/section of some information which is indepent in its own. Section can store multiple articles.
5) **Navigation** tag helps to guide us about different locations.
6) **Aside** tag helps us to divide the data from the main and visualize it separately.

Semantic tag article and semantic tag section both have few similarities but are used for different purposes.
When we have standalone meaning and resuable content then we used Articles.
But when we have related content which can be grouped together then we combine them in section.

## Form and Media
The data collection mechanism in HTML is achieved through forms. It enables the **interaction** between the users and the system.
Form provides you mutiple input controls and fields such as- Text, email, checkbox, select, dropdown, date etc. and provides you multiple features also such as Label, Legend, Placeholder etc. These are used to improve the accessibility of the content and for better understanding purposes espscially for screen readers and differntly-abled people.

HTML allows you to store multiple kinds of media aswell such as images, videos, etc.
We can store images using img tag, and we can also use fig tag which helps us give a caption to our image also using figcaption tag.

## ARIA: Accesible Rich Internet Application
It refers to the additional information which is given to assist technologies, when HTML alone is not enough then we use ARIA tag for labelling navigation, describing and clarifying content. ARIA tag specifically helps screen readers and assists them to learn better.
